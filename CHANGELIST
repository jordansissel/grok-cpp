20080327:
  - Added Python bindings. See pygrok/DOCUMENTATION for usage.
  - Added test for python bindings.
  - Added example file 'pygrok/example.py'

Before releasing...
  - Added GrokMatch::SetMatchMetaValue() which lets you inject arbitrary 
    key-value pairs into the matchmap returned by GrokMatch::GetMatches()
  - Added function string parsing for filters so we can accept 
    %foo|func(arg1,arg2...)%
  - Added a DNS filter. Default is to do an A record lookup. Examples:
    %foo|dns% == A record lookup on %foo%
    %foo|dns()% == A record lookup on %foo%
    %foo|dns(A)% == A record lookup on %foo%
    %foo|dns(AAAA)% == AAAA record lookup on %foo%
    %foo|dns(PTR)% == PTR record lookup on %foo%

    %foo|dns(PTR,A)% == does a lookup IP -(PTR)> domain name -(A)> IP
    Basically applies PTR first, then A. Same as:
    %foo|dns(PTR)|dns(A)%
